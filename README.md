<h1>Horiseon Landing Page Restructure</h1>
<h3>A rework of a current landing page faced with acessibility issues, and general code cleanup.</h3>

<p>Horiseon is a company that provides information regarding social marketing. When given the initial code, I found it was missing alternative text for the images, and most of the html elements were 'div' tags, which can make things messy in the accompanying CSS file.</p> 
  <p>The application can be run via any browser, and can be navigated via scrolling, or clicking on the three phrases on the navigation bar. </p>
